GuideRNA-UCSC-Visualization
This repository contains a Python-based workflow to generate UCSC Genome Browser links with custom tracks for visualizing guide RNA sequences. The guide RNA sequences are produced using CASowary, targeting long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and are visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser.

Project Overview

This project consists of two main components:

Guide RNA Generation: The guide RNA sequences used in this project were generated using CASowary, which can be found at the official repository: CASowary GitHub. CASowary was used to produce guide sequences specifically targeting long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

UCSC Genome Browser Link Generation: Once the guide RNA sequences were generated, this project includes a Python script that creates UCSC Genome Browser links with custom tracks for visualizing the guide RNAs.

Installation git clone https://github.iu.edu/sbabburi/GuideRNA-UCSC-Visualization cd GuideRNA-UCSC-Visualization

Open the Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the .ipynb file in your local environment: jupyter notebook UCSC_LINK Code.ipynb

Run the Cells: Follow the instructions in the notebook and run the code cells to generate the UCSC Genome Browser links.
